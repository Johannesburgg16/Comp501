<h3>Opportunities about our chosen topic by, Johann Guadalupe.</h3>
<p>For university students, online learning offers a variety of opportunities. A key advantage for our students is 
  the opportunity to learn at their own pace as so their own schedule. This is quite an advantage for students who 
  have other matters on hand like employment or family obligations. Adding to this with online learning we are given 
  a greater variety of resources and programs that might not be offered in more traditional institutions. Students can
   also learn the abilities like self-discipline, time management, and digital literacy with the use of online learning.
    In online education recent events have caused it to grow in popularity, especially around higher education. Based on
     an evaluation of relevant research and sources, I will examine the opportunities of online learning for university
      students in comparison to traditional learning.  </p>

  <p>One beneficial attribute to online learning is the amount of flexibility for university students. This gives students 
    their own ability to work at their own pace and a easier way to work with their schedule. This is really a benefit to 
    university students as at an older age they would have other commitments like work, personal hobbies and family 
    responsibilities. An example of this can be seen from the Western Governors University, “at institutions like WGU, you
     can complete coursework and take exams according to your schedule. With competency-based education, you can move more
      quickly through material you understand well, and spend more time on material you need help with. This flexibility means
       that you're in charge of your schedule.” This is a great leap to helping students ease their struggle and stress with
        busy schedules as online learning allows you to spread out your education and study when its most convenient for them. 
        A struggle this can be linked with university students is the lack of travel and accommodation cost being eliminated as
         online learning offers a more affordable approach than traditional learning. </p>

  <p>The ability to interact with peers and lecturers/professors from around the world is another benefit to online learning.
     The misconception of online learning to be isolated can be false as there are multiple software's and networks that allow 
     users to interact through many things. These can be stuff like discussion boards which AUT website has or chat rooms like
      discord. “Most students also said regular updates and clear communication were key to helping them learn online by reducing
       the sense of isolation and distance.” Students in online courses may come from a variety of countries and ethnic backgrounds.
        This gives students the opportunity to learn from each other and build a network of contacts. It provides assistance 
        for students to have beneficial discussions and share different viewpoints and information. “Establish opportunities for
         students to give and receive self, peer and teacher feedback/foster social learning and social presence online by 
         nurturing relationships and creating opportunities for group interaction.” This can prove online learning can offer
          opportunities for more frequent interaction between students, peers and teachers with the use of emails, video conferencing,
           online meetings, and discussion boards. This gives students the chance to pick the brains of industry experts and 
           make useful contacts that can progress their careers. </p>

  <p>Also one very beneficial point for online learning is that it provideds a greater accessibility of resources and education 
    for university students. Examples of this can be resources like online libaries which infact AUT has, digital textbooks, and 
    online programming services. Universities are able to provide courses to students that may be restricted due to personal or other
     reasons. “Online learning allows students to attend classes from anywhere. Students can record online lectures, access archived 
     courses and learning materials, and share schoolwork. This allows students to log in to their virtual campus from the comfort of
      home. “  Due to how open online learning is it creates a more accessible type of education as it allows students to access things
       with ease. Online learning stops the requirement of students to be physically  be on campus. This allows students who reside 
       lives in distantr places and areas as they would benefit due to the easy access with online learning. Compared to traditional 
       learning online learning offers a whole new world of resources and programs that a student can gain and learn. These benefits
        are great for people who aren't able to get in person resources due to personal problems like financial issue, etc. </p>

  <p>In conclusion, the opportunities that online learning offers to us university students is very beneficial. It offers an abundance 
    of advantages, this includes flexibility for students with their schedules, access to resources and programs giving a more broad 
    variety, and the ability to learn to network on a vast range of people to grow educationally. Although online learning gives students 
    several advantages its vital to be knowledgeable of the negative side, like the restricted social connection, the tech difficulties
     or inaccessibility to networks, and the requirement for self-control and time management. Among students to make a decision between
      online learning and traditional learning, it is essential to carefully consider their particular requirements and areas of interest.  </p>
