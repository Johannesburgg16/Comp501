<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic: </h1>
</ul><h4><p>The Benefits and Drawbacks of Online Learning in contrast to Traditional Learning (University students)<p></h4>

<p><em>We chose this topic because of both advantages and disadvantages of online learning exist for college students. 
  We are  able to talk about the individual Flexibility for students, simple content access, collaborative content 
  development, and cost are a few advantages. Students can study at their own pace and choose the best time to read 
  material and turn in assignments when they are learning online. Additionally, it avoids the expenses associated with 
  student housing, meals, and transportation. </p></em>

<p><em> Online education does, however, have significant drawbacks. These include the unequal distribution of technology
   and internet access, the absence of physical contact, the reduction in concentration, the impact on health, and the 
   requirement for technological literacy1. Online education might not be appropriate for all courses or students, and
    it might run into problems with internet and electricity services. </p></em>
